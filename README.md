**4080 Capstone Project**

**Description:** 

  Our project task was to utilize the ruby gem gosu to create a fun multiplayer game that is easy to understand and play.

  When run the timer starts counting down from 60 and players have to collect as many stars and get the highest score. 

  Player 1 controls the crewmate using WASD and Player 2 uses the arrow keys. 

**Installation**

  Both Ruby and the Gosu gem are needed to run the program.
